# CoderBot developer documentation

This site hosts the technical documentation of CoderBot.

The documentation covers all aspects required to understand how CoderBot works, how to improve and extend the project both for the hardware and software components.

Please visit [Description](Description.md) for a general description of the project: features, objectives, use cases.

You may then consult the [Getting started](Getting_started.md) guide in order to install the CoderBot software and start developing.

It is adviseable to have a loook at the more detailed description of both the [Hardware Architecture](Hardware_Architecture.md) and [Sofware Architecture](Software_Architecture.md), as well as the [Backend](Backend.md) and [Frontend](Frontend.md) components descriptions.
