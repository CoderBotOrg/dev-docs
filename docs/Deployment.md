# Deployment

To install a "Production-ready" (that is, a CoderBot instance ready for normal use, but not suited for developement), follow these steps:

- download the newest image from [CoderBot distributions site](https://repo.coderbot.org)
- unzip and flash the image on a micro-sd card with the [Raspberry-provided desktop app](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) (select "custom image" from the menu, then select the downloaded image from disk)
- insert the micro-sd card in the Raspberry Pi slot, then boot the Raspberry Pi.
